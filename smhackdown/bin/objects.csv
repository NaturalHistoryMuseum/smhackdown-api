What could be referred to as folk medicine – customs that often went back generations – continued to be practised. For example, this dried frog carried in a silk bag was used to prevent fits. Alternatively, another amulet against fits involved wearing a live toad in a bag. Live frogs and toads were also bound on to wounds to help them heal and were placed on the throats of children with whooping cough. The dried frog was purchased in 1930 from Edward Lovett’s (1852-1933) collection of British amulets and charms.

Charles Babbage conceived the idea of building an automatic calculating machine which would eliminate the inaccuracy that occurred when compiling mathematical tables by hand.
